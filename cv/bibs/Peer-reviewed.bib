  abstract = {To determine the day-to-day and longer-term longitudinal associations between daytime physical activity and night-time sleep.We used data from a 2-year longitudinal study which included three time points (i.e. baseline, year 1, and year 2). Participants were recruited from primary schools and included 1059 children (50\% girls) with a mean age of 8.81-years-old (SD = 0.72) at baseline. Sleep variables included sleep duration, sleep efficiency, time in bed, sleep onset, and wake time. Physical activity variables included light, moderate, moderate-to-vigorous, and vigorous physical activity as well as sedentary time. We objectively assessed physical activity and sleep behaviors using the GENEActiv wrist-worn accelerometer over an 8-day period at each timepoint for a potential 21 190 observed days.We used fixed-effects multilevel models and parallel latent growth curve modeling to examine day-to-day and longer-term associations, respectively. Day-to-day, physical activity, and sleep variables were significantly, positively, and bidirectionally associated, except for sleep efficiency, which showed little association with physical activity. Longer-term, we found little association between physical activity and sleep variables.Overall, our findings indicate that there is a day-to-day association between the amount of time spent being physically active and improved sleep. The lack of a longer-term association indicates that a focus on children's daily behavior may be most appropriate to help children improve sleep and increase physical activity.},

While the number of days needed and hours/day for estimates of physical activity and sedentary time are generally known, the criteria for sleep estimates are more uncertain. The objective of this study was to identify the number of nights needed to obtain reliable estimates of habitual sleep behaviour using the GENEActiv wrist worn accelerometer. The number of days to obtain reliable estimate of physical activity was also examined.                                         Methods               Data was used from a two-year longitudinal study. Children wore an accelerometer for up to 8 days 24~h/day across three timepoints. The sample included 2,745 children (51\,\% girls) between the ages of 7-12-years-old (mean\,=\,9.8 years, SD\,=\,1.1 year) with valid accelerometer data from any timepoint. Reliability estimates were calculated for sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep onset, wake time, time in bed, light physical activity, moderate physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, vigorous physical activity, and sedentary time.                                         Results               Intraclass correlations and the Spearman Brown prophecy formula were used to determine the nights and days needed for reliable estimates. We found that between 3 and 5 nights were needed to achieve acceptable reliability (ICC\,=\,0.7) in sleep outcomes, while physical activity and sedentary time outcomes required between 3 and 4 days.                                         Conclusions               To obtain reliable estimates, researchers should consider these minimum criteria when designing their studies and prepare strategies to ensure sufficient wear time compliance.},

This study aimed to describe concurrent trajectories of outdoor time, screen time and sleep across the early childhood period and their maternal predictors.                                         Methods               Data across five time points at child age 4, 9, 19, 42 and 60~months from the INFANT intervention were analysed. Mothers reported their child's usual outdoor time, screen time and sleep duration, in addition to a range of maternal beliefs, attitudes, expectations and behaviours. Group-based multi-trajectory modelling was used to model concurrent trajectories of children's behaviours. Multinomial logistic regression models determined the associations of maternal predictors with trajectory groups, adjusting for child sex and baseline age, intervention allocation, and clustering by recruitment.                                         Results                                Of the 542 children recruited, 528 had data for outdoor time, screen time and sleep at one or more time points and were included in trajectory analyses Four trajectories were identified:                 `unstable sleep, increasing outdoor time, low screen'                 ({\textasciitilde}\,22\% of sample),                 `high outdoor time, low screen, high sleep'                 ({\textasciitilde}\,24\%),                 `high sleep, increasing outdoor time, low screen'                 ({\textasciitilde}\,45\%),                 `high screen, increasing outdoor time, high sleep'                 ({\textasciitilde}\,10\%). The                 `high sleep, increasing outdoor time, low screen'                 group, comprising the largest percentage of the sample, demonstrated the healthiest behaviours. Predictors of group membership included: views of physically active children, screen time knowledge, screen time use, self-efficacy, physical activity optimism, future expectations for children's physical activity and screen time, perceptions of floor play safety, and maternal physical activity, screen time, and sleep quality.                                                        Conclusions               Four distinct trajectories of outdoor time, screen time and sleep were identified, with the most common (and healthiest) characterized by high levels of sleep. Maternal beliefs, attitudes, expectations and behaviours are important in the development of movement behaviour trajectories across early childhood. Future interventions and public policy may benefit from targeting these factors to support healthy movement behaviours from a young age.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               The distribution of time across physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and sleep appears to be essential for the management of obesity. However, the impact of reallocating time among these behaviors, collectively known as 24-h movement behaviors, remains underexplored.                                         Objective               This study examines the theoretical effects of reallocating time between 24-h movement behaviors on obesity indicators across different age groups.                                         Methods               We performed a pooled data meta-analysis of 9818 participants from 11 observational and experimental studies. To estimate the time spent in movement behaviors, we reprocessed and harmonized individual-level raw accelerometer-derived data. Isotemporal substitution models estimated theoretical changes in body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) associated with time reallocation between movement behaviors. We performed the analysis separately for children, adolescents, adults, and older adults.                                         Results                                Even minor reallocations of 10~min led to significant changes in obesity indicators, with pronounced effects observed when 30~min were reallocated. The most substantial adverse effects on BMI and WC occurred when moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was reallocated to other movement behaviors. For 30-min reallocations, the largest increase in BMI (or BMI                 z                 -score for children) occurred when MVPA was reallocated to light-intensity physical activity (LPA) in children (0.26 units, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.15, 0.37) and to sedentary behavior (SB) in adults (0.72~kg/m                 2                 , 95\% CI 0.47, 0.96) and older adults (0.73~kg/m                 2                 , 95\% CI 0.59, 0.87). The largest increase in WC was observed when MVPA was substituted with LPA in adults (2.66~cm, 95\% CI 1.42, 3.90) and with SB in older adults (2.43~cm, 95\% CI 2.07, 2.79). Conversely, the highest magnitude of the decrease in obesity indicators was observed when SB was substituted with MVPA. Specifically, substituting 30~min of SB with MVPA was associated with a decrease in BMI                 z                 -score by\,-\,0.15 units (95\% CI\,-\,0.21,\,-\,0.10) in children and lower BMI by\,-\,0.56~kg/m                 2                 (95\% CI\,-\,0.74,\,-\,0.39) in adults and by\,-\,0.52~kg/m                 2                 (95\% CI\,-\,0.61,\,-\,0.43) in older adults. Reallocating time away from sleep and LPA showed several significant changes but lacked a consistent pattern. While the predicted changes in obesity indicators were generally consistent across age groups, inconsistent findings were observed in adolescents, particularly for reallocations between MVPA and other behaviors.                                                        Conclusions               This investigation emphasizes the crucial role of MVPA in mitigating obesity risk across the lifespan, and the benefit of substituting SB with low-intensity movement behaviors. The distinct patterns observed in adolescents suggest a need for age-specific lifestyle interventions to effectively address obesity. Emphasizing manageable shifts, such as 10-min reallocations, could have significant public health implications, promoting sustainable lifestyle changes that accommodate individuals with diverse needs, including those with severe obesity.},

  abstract = {Individuals' subjective well-being (SWB) is an important marker of development and social progress. As psychological health issues often begin during adolescence, understanding the factors that enhance SWB among adolescents is critical to devising preventive interventions. However, little is known about how institutional contexts contribute to adolescent SWB. Using Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015 and 2018 data from 78 countries ( N = 941,475), we find that gender gaps in adolescents' SWB (life satisfaction, positive and negative affect) are larger in more gender-equal countries. Results paradoxically indicated that gender equality enhances boys' but not girls' SWB, suggesting that greater gender equality may facilitate social comparisons across genders. This may lead to an increased awareness of discrimination against females and consequently lower girls' SWB, diluting the overall benefits of gender equality. These findings underscore the need for researchers and policy-makers to better understand macro-level factors, beyond objective gender equality, that support girls' SWB.},

  abstract = {Objectives To determine if subpopulations of students benefit equally from school-based physical activity interventions in terms of cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity. To examine if physical activity intensity mediates improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness.Design Pooled analysis of individual participant data from controlled trials that assessed the impact of school-based physical activity interventions on cardiorespiratory fitness and device-measured physical activity.Participants Data for 6621 children and adolescents aged 4--18 years from 20 trials were included.Main outcome measures Peak oxygen consumption (VO2Peak mL/kg/min) and minutes of moderate and vigorous physical activity.Results Interventions modestly improved students' cardiorespiratory fitness by 0.47 mL/kg/min (95\% CI 0.33 to 0.61), but the effects were not distributed equally across subpopulations. Girls and older students benefited less than boys and younger students, respectively. Students with lower levels of initial fitness, and those with higher levels of baseline physical activity benefitted more than those who were initially fitter and less active, respectively. Interventions had a modest positive effect on physical activity with approximately one additional minute per day of both moderate and vigorous physical activity. Changes in vigorous, but not moderate intensity, physical activity explained a small amount ( 5\%) of the intervention effect on cardiorespiratory fitness.Conclusions Future interventions should include targeted strategies to address the needs of girls and older students. Interventions may also be improved by promoting more vigorous intensity physical activity. Interventions could mitigate declining youth cardiorespiratory fitness, increase physical activity and promote cardiovascular health if they can be delivered equitably and their effects sustained at the population level.},

  abstract = {Introduction                                Efficacious programmes require implementation at scale to maximise their public health impact.                 TransformUs                 is an efficacious behavioural and environmental intervention for increasing primary (elementary) school children's (5--12 years) physical activity and reducing their sedentary behaviour within school and home settings. This paper describes the study protocol of a 5-year effectiveness--implementation trial to assess the scalability and effectiveness of the                 TransformUs                 programme.                                                        Methods and analysis                                A type II hybrid implementation--effectiveness trial,                 TransformUs                 is being disseminated to all primary schools in the state of Victoria, Australia (n=1786). Data are being collected using mixed methods at the system (state government, partner organisations), organisation (school) and individual (teacher, parent and child) levels. Evaluation is based on programme Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. RE-AIM domains are being measured using a quasi-experimental, pre/post, non-equivalent group design, at baseline, 12 and 24\,months. Effectiveness will be determined in a subsample of 20 intervention schools (in Victoria) and 20 control schools (in New South Wales (NSW), Australia), at baseline, 12 and 24\,months. Primary outcomes include                 TransformUs                 Reach, Adoption, Implementation and organisational Maintenance (implementation trial), and children's physical activity and sedentary time assessed using accelerometers (effectiveness trial). Secondary outcomes include average sedentary time and moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity on weekdays and during school hours, body mass index z-scores and waist circumference (effectiveness trial). Linear mixed-effects models will be fitted to compare outcomes between intervention and control participants accounting for clustering of children within schools, confounding and random effects.                                                        Ethics and dissemination               The trial was approved by the Deakin University Human Research Ethics Committee (HEAG-H 28\_2017), Victorian Department of Education, the NSW Department of Education, Australian Catholic University (2017-145R), Melbourne Archdiocese Catholic Schools and Catholic Schools NSW. Partners, schools/teachers and parents will provide an informed signed consent form prior to participating. Parents will provide consent for their child to participate in the effectiveness trial. Findings will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, scientific conferences, summary reports to schools and our partner organisations, and will inform education policy and practice on effective and sustainable ways to promote physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviours population-wide.

Completing professional learning can improve work performance; however, many individuals who begin online courses do not complete them. It is not well understood which influences keep individuals engaged in online professional learning. We address these issues with a systematic review. Our review of 51 studies and 9,583 participants includes a narrative synthesis and a meta-analysis that examined influences on user engagement in online professional learning. We found that course design and employers' provision of time to complete learning are key for engaging learners. Other important influences were learners' reasons for learning (e.g., intrinsic value and perceived usefulness), access to learning support, and opportunities for interaction during the learning experience.},

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the scale-up of the `Internet-based Professional Learning to help teachers promote Activity in Youth' (iPLAY) intervention in primary schools using the RE-AIM framework.                                         Methods                                We conducted a type 3 hybrid implementation-effectiveness study and collected data between April 2016 and June 2021, in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. RE-AIM was operationalised as: (i) Reach: Number and representativeness of students exposed to iPLAY; (ii) Effectiveness: Impact of iPLAY in a sub-sample of students (                 n                 \,=\,5,959); (iii) Adoption: Number and representativeness of schools that received iPLAY; (iv) Implementation: Extent to which the three curricular and three non-curricular components of iPLAY were delivered as intended; (v) Maintenance: Extent to which iPLAY was sustained in schools. We conducted 43 semi-structured interviews with teachers (                 n                 \,=\,14), leaders (                 n                 \,=\,19), and principals (                 n                 \,=\,10) from 18 schools (11 from urban and 7 from rural locations) to determine program maintenance.                                                        Results               Reach: iPLAY reached\,{\textasciitilde}\,31,000 students from a variety of socio-economic strata (35\% of students were in the bottom quartile, almost half in the middle two quartiles, and 20\% in the top quartile). Effectiveness: We observed small positive intervention effects for enjoyment of PE/sport (0.12 units, 95\% CI: 0.05 to 0.20, d\,=\,0.17), perceptions of need support from teachers (0.26 units, 95\% CI: 0.16 to 0.53, d\,=\,0.40), physical activity participation (0.28 units, 95\% CI: 0.10 to 0.47, d\,=\,0.14), and subjective well-being (0.82 units, 95\% CI: 0.32 to 1.32, d\,=\,0.12) at 24-months. Adoption: 115 schools received iPLAY. Implementation: Most schools implemented the curricular (59\%) and non-curricular (55\%) strategies as intended. Maintenance: Based on our qualitative data, changes in teacher practices and school culture resulting from iPLAY were sustained.                                         Conclusions               iPLAY had extensive reach and adoption in NSW primary schools. Most of the schools implemented iPLAY as intended and effectiveness data suggest the positive effects observed in our cluster RCT were sustained when the intervention was delivered at-scale.

Design               Systematic review and network meta-analysis.                                         Methods               Screening, data extraction, coding, and risk of bias assessment were performed independently and in duplicate. Bayesian arm based, multilevel network meta-analyses were performed for the primary analyses. Quality of the evidence for each arm was graded using the confidence in network meta-analysis (CINeMA) online tool.                                         Data sources               Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, SPORTDiscus, and PsycINFO databases.                                         Eligibility criteria for selecting studies               Any randomised trial with exercise arms for participants meeting clinical cut-offs for major depression.                                         Results               218 unique studies with a total of 495 arms and 14\,170 participants were included. Compared with active controls (eg, usual care, placebo tablet), moderate reductions in depression were found for walking or jogging (n=1210, {$\kappa$}=51, Hedges' g -0.62, 95\% credible interval -0.80 to -0.45), yoga (n=1047, {$\kappa$}=33, g -0.55, -0.73 to -0.36), strength training (n=643, {$\kappa$}=22, g -0.49, -0.69 to -0.29), mixed aerobic exercises (n=1286, {$\kappa$}=51, g -0.43, -0.61 to -0.24), and tai chi or qigong (n=343, {$\kappa$}=12, g -0.42, -0.65 to -0.21). The effects of exercise were proportional to the intensity prescribed. Strength training and yoga appeared to be the most acceptable modalities. Results appeared robust to publication bias, but only one study met the Cochrane criteria for low risk of bias. As a result, confidence in accordance with CINeMA was low for walking or jogging and very low for other treatments.                                         Conclusions               Exercise is an effective treatment for depression, with walking or jogging, yoga, and strength training more effective than other exercises, particularly when intense. Yoga and strength training were well tolerated compared with other treatments. Exercise appeared equally effective for people with and without comorbidities and with different baseline levels of depression. To mitigate expectancy effects, future studies could aim to blind participants and staff. These forms of exercise could be considered alongside psychotherapy and antidepressants as core treatments for depression.

Cognitive load theory and the cognitive theory of multimedia learning both postulate that the quality of multimedia design heavily influences learning. We sought to identify how to best design multimedia and review how well those learning theories held up to meta-analyses. We conducted an overview of systematic reviews that tested the effects of multimedia design on learning or cognitive load. We found 29 reviews including 1,189 studies and 78,177 participants. We found 11 design principles that demonstrated significant, positive, meta-analytic effects on learning and five that significantly improved management of cognitive load. The largest benefits were for captioning second-language videos, temporal/spatial contiguity, and signaling. We also found robust evidence for modality, animation, coherence/removing seductive details, anthropomorphics, segmentation, personalization, pedagogical agents, and verbal redundancy effects. Good design was more important for more complex materials, and in system-paced environments (e.g., lectures) than self-paced ones (e.g., websites). Results supported many tenets of both theories. We highlight a range of evidence-based strategies that could be implemented by educators.},

We systematically reviewed the effects of video on learning in higher education. We searched five databases using 27 keywords to find randomized trials that measured the learning effects of video among college students. We conducted full-text screening, data extraction, and risk of bias in duplicate. We calculated pooled effect sizes using multilevel random-effects meta-analysis. Searches retrieved 9,677 unique records. After screening 329 full texts, 105 met inclusion criteria, with a pooled sample of 7,776 students. Swapping video for existing teaching methods led to small improvements in student learning (g = 0.28). Adding video to existing teaching led to strong learning benefits (g = 0.80). Although results may be subject to some experimental and publication biases, they suggest that videos are unlikely to be detrimental and usually improve student learning.},

The current study aimed to explore the enablers and barriers to effective implementation of and compliance with school-based food and beverage policies.                                         Design:               Systematic review and meta-synthesis. Eight electronic databases were searched for articles in June 2019. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported on implementation and/or compliance of school-based food and/or beverage policies with outcomes relating to enablers and/or barriers. This review had no restrictions on study design, year of publication or language. Seventy-two full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, of which twenty-eight were included in this review.                                         Setting:               Studies conducted globally that focused on schools.                                         Participants:               School-based healthy food and beverage policies.                                         Results:               Financial (cost of policy-compliant foods, decreased profit and revenue), physical (availability of policy-compliant foods, close geographical proximity to unhealthy food outlets) and social (poor knowledge, understanding, and negative stakeholders' attitudes towards policy) factors were the most frequently reported barriers for policy implementation. Sufficient funding, effective policy communication and management, and positive stakeholders' attitudes were the most frequently reported enablers for policy implementation.                                         Conclusions:               There is a need for better communication strategies, financial and social support prior to school-based food policy implementation. Findings of this review contribute to a thorough understanding of factors that underpin best practice recommendations for the implementation of school-based food policy, and inform those responsible for improving public health nutrition.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               The physical activity (PA) levels of many children and adolescents in Australia are currently insufficient to promote health benefits. Physical education (PE) programs aim to promote PA and reach nearly all school-aged children, but PA levels within PE lessons are often low. PE teachers may influence children's motivation to be physically active in PE lessons, but little is known about teacher strategies that effectively motivate children to participate in PA, and few intervention studies have examined motivational strategies in PE. The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of three motivational strategies, each based on Self-Determination Theory (SDT), on PA levels, and their hypothesized antecedents, during year 8 PE lessons.                                         Methods/design               This study employed a cluster-randomized controlled trial design. Following a familiarization session, PA levels and hypothesized PA antecedents were measured during a baseline lesson and a post-intervention or control lesson. Teachers (n = 16) and their classes from five secondary schools in Sydney, Australia were randomly assigned into four blocks and instructed to provide one of four 20-min lesson teaching strategy conditions: (1) explaining the relevance of activities; (2) providing choice from PA options selected by the teacher; (3) providing equipment and free choice of activities; or (4) usual practice. The primary outcomes were lesson time spent in moderate-to-vigorous PA, and motivation towards the lesson. Secondary outcomes were perceptions of teacher behavior, psychological needs satisfaction, and lesson time spent in sedentary behavior. PA and sedentary behavior were measured during baseline and post-intervention lessons with waist-mounted Actigraph GT3X accelerometers. Teacher behavior, psychological needs satisfaction, and motivation were assessed via questionnaires at the end of each lesson. Linear mixed-model analyses will be run on all outcomes, with students nested within teachers as a random effect.                                         Discussion               Study findings will inform the development of effective SDT-based teaching strategy interventions to enhance students' psychological needs satisfaction, motivation, and PA levels. More effective teaching strategies may be identified that are capable of improving adolescents' PA levels, and thereby provide beneficial population health outcomes.                                         Trial registration               This trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials and is traceable as ISRCTN07038258.},

However, new evidence suggests that exposure at moderate levels may not be harmful and may even provide benefit. Therefore, our objective was to determine if there are curvilinear relationships between different types of screen time and a diverse set of outcomes, including health and education.                                         Methods                                We address our objective using a repeated measures design. Children (                 N                 ~=\,4013), initially aged 10--11 were assessed every 2 years between 2010 and 2014. Children's screen time behavior was measured using time-use diaries, and categorized into five types: social, passive, interactive, educational, or other. We used measures of children's physical health, health-related quality of life, socio-emotional outcomes, and school achievement. The analysis plan was pre-registered. Models were adjusted for gender, socio-economic status, ethnicity, number of siblings, and housing factors.                                                        Results               There were linear associations between total screen time and all outcomes, such that more screen time was associated with worse outcomes. However, there was variability when examined by screen time type. Passive screen time (e.g., TV) was associated with worse outcomes, educational screen time (e.g., computer for homework) was associated with positive educational outcomes and had no negative relations with other outcomes. Interactive screen time (e.g., video games) had positive associations with educational outcomes but negative associations with other outcomes. In all instances, these significant associations were small or very small, with standardised effects {$<$}\,0.07. We found little evidence of curvilinear relationships.                                         Conclusions               The small effects of screen time on children's outcomes appear to be moderated by the type of screen time. Policy makers, educators, and parents should consider the type of screen time when considering the benefits and harms of use.},

  abstract = {Previous Self-Determination Theory (SDT) research has highlighted the impact of physical education (PE) teachers' (de)motivating styles on students' motivation, in-class moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and sedentary behaviour. However, most studies relied on questionnaires to assess PE teachers' (de)motivating styles, and the few that used observations focused primarily on one specific (de)motivating style in relation to motivational outcomes, overlooking behavioural outcomes. This study advances SDT-based research by examining associations between PE teachers' observed (de)motivating styles (i.e. four styles, eight approaches, and 43 behaviours), students' motivation (i.e. intrinsic motivation, identified regulation, introjected regulation, external regulation, and amotivation), and students' device-based in-class MVPA and sedentary behaviour. A total of 79 secondary school PE teachers and 885 students participated. One PE lesson per teacher was recorded and (de)motivating styles were rated using the Situation-in-School Physical Education-Coder (SIS-PE-Coder). Students completed an online questionnaire to assess their motivation and wore Actigraph accelerometers to measure in-class MVPA and sedentary behaviour. Linear mixed-effects models, controlling for the lesson topic, and students' sex and age, revealed that PE teachers' observed attuning approach related positively and demanding and abandoning approaches related negatively to students' intrinsic motivation. The demanding approach also related positively to students' introjected regulation. Notably, the demanding approach showed a dual pathway, negatively relating to intrinsic motivation but positively relating to in-class MVPA. In turn, intrinsic motivation was positively related to in-class MVPA. By relying on observations, the findings suggest that PE teachers can optimize student motivation by being more attuning and less demanding and abandoning.},

  abstract = {\&lt;h4\&gt;Purpose\&lt;/h4\&gt;In this study, we tested the effectiveness of a multicomponent sports-based program aimed at promoting early intervention, help seeking, and resilience among a sample of adolescent male sport participants.\&lt;h4\&gt;Methods\&lt;/h4\&gt;The Ahead of the Game program comprised four intervention components and a messaging campaign. Two components targeted mental health literacy, intentions to seek and provide help, and resilience among adolescent boys. A mental health literacy program for parents and a coach education program to assist in the support of athletes' psychological needs were also included. We evaluated the program using a nonrandomized controlled trial matching two regional communities. In total, 350 sport participants (mean, 14.53 yr) were included in an intervention group, whereas 466 (mean, 14.66 yr) received usual practice in a matched control community. One hundred and eighty parents or caregivers and eight coaches also participated in the intervention components. Between-group mean differences on the primary and secondary outcomes were analyzed using linear mixed models, adjusted for clustering at club level, participant age, and socioeconomic status.\&lt;h4\&gt;Results\&lt;/h4\&gt;Significant positive group-time interactions were found for the primary outcomes of depression and anxiety literacy, intentions to seek help from formal sources, confidence to seek mental health information, and resilience. We also found a significant positive group-time interaction for the secondary outcome of well-being. There were no group-time interactions for social distance (stigma), intentions to seek help from informal sources, implicit beliefs about adversity, perceived familial support, or psychological distress.\&lt;h4\&gt;Conclusions\&lt;/h4\&gt;Given the high rates of sport participation worldwide and the increasing focus on mental health in this domain, translation and dissemination of the program may be warranted after replication.},

  abstract = {Abstract             We conducted a systematic review to evaluate combinations of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep duration (defined as ``movement behaviors'') and their associations with physical, psychological, and educational outcomes in children and adolescents. MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsychInfo, SPORTDiscus, PubMed, EMBASE, and ERIC were searched in June 2020. Included studies needed to 1) quantitatively analyze the association of 2 or more movement behaviors with an outcome, 2) analyze a population between 5 and 17 years of age, and 3) include at least an English abstract. We included 141 studies. Most studies included the combination of physical activity and sedentary behavior in their analyses. Sleep was studied less frequently. In combination, a high level of physical activity and a low level of sedentary behavior were associated with the best physical health, psychological health, and education-related outcomes. Sleep was often included in the combination that was associated with the most favorable outcomes. Sedentary behavior had a stronger influence in adolescents than in children and tended to be associated more negatively with outcomes when it was defined as screen time than when defined as overall time spent being sedentary. More initiatives and guidelines combining all 3 movement behaviors will provide benefit with regard to adiposity, cardiometabolic risk factors, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular physical fitness, well-being, health-related quality of life, mental health, academic performance, and cognitive/executive function.},

The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that movement behaviors (ie,~physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep) and changes in combinations of movement behaviors over time (movement trajectories) mediate the relationship between socioeconomic position and socioemotional outcomes in youth.                                Methods                 :                              This study used socioeconomic position data, scores from Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires, and time-use diaries from 980 females and 1014 males (2\% Australian Indigenous) aged 10--14 from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children from 2014 to 2018.                                Results                 :                              Movement trajectories did not mediate the relationship between socioeconomic position and socioemotional outcomes. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-based mediation analyses found males from lower socioeconomic positions participated in less moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity than their peers from high socioeconomic positions, partially explaining (7\%) more peer problems. Youth from lower socioeconomic positions participated in more recreational screen activities than their peers from higher socioeconomic positions, partially explaining (1\%--3\%) worse total socioemotional outcomes and conduct (females) and emotional problems (males).                                Conclusions                 :                              Future qualitative research should be considered to identify the best ways for youth from lower socioeconomic positions to decrease screen time and increase opportunities to participate in moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity in the community, at school, and at home. Other mediators explaining differences in socioemotional outcomes should be explored.},

Youth vary in how they accumulate these behaviors, both in volume and specific domains (e.g., sedentary time spent on recreational screen activities vs homework). The aim of this study was to examine how youth's combined general and domain-specific movement trajectories differ by socioeconomic position.                                         Methods               We conducted a longitudinal, group-based multi-trajectory analysis to identify general and domain-specific movement trajectory profiles for 2457 youth from age 10 to 14~years from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children from 2014--2018. We used multinomial logistic regression to test if socioeconomic position predicted profile membership.                                         Results               We identified three general movement trajectory profiles for both sexes, four domain-specific profiles for males, and five for females. For general movement trajectories, females from lower socioeconomic positions were more likely to be a combination of less active and more sedentary than females from higher socioeconomic positions. Males across socioeconomic positions spend similar amounts of time in physical activity, sedentary time, and sleep. For domain-specific movement trajectories, youth from lower socioeconomic positions were likely to spend a combination of less time in education-based sedentary behavior and more time in recreational screen activities than their higher socioeconomic position peers.                                         Conclusion               Our results indicate that socioeconomic position predicted in which domains youth accumulate their movements. Future observational research and interventions targeting different socioeconomic groups should therefore consider domain-specific movement trajectories.},
